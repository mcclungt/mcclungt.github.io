			<p>
				As shown in this <a href="http://xkcd.com/327/">XKCD comic</a>, databases can be fragile. In this case, if a person with the name Robert') DROP TABLE Students;-- was entered into the database, it would cause the table to be erased. Now this is obviously a hyperbolic and comedic scenario, but it does shed some light onto the problems with SQL injection. <br>
				&emsp; SQL databases are very good for a lot of situations, but companies like google and amazon don't user them. Why is that? Well, SQL tables and fields are highly interconnected, and while this is useful when dealing with different groups of information, when you're dealing with a large scale project that has enormous amounts of data (like google and amazon) these connections bog down speed and efficiency. <br>
				&emsp; Personally, I'm just beginning to familiarize myself with SQL and this format. I see the merit of NoSQL and other databases but I think I'll stick with SQL as long as I can, now that I understand it.
