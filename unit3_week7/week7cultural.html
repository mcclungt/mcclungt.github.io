			<p>
				Back in week 2, we took a look at a list of values and picked some of them that we felt apply to our goals. I chose Accomplishment, Integrity, Competition, and Persistence. While I like to think that these values apply to my character, at the very least I see these values as a representative of my goals for myself. <br>
				&emsp;Now last week we wrote about stereotype threat, and the problems it presents in the tech world. When it comes to avoiding stereotype threat, the values that apply the most are integrity, competition, and persistence, each in their own way.<br>
				&emsp;Competition can be seen as one of the roots of stereotyping. In order for the best results to be achieved, we need competition, as it brings out the best in all of us. But on the other hand, stereotyping can be used as a defense mechanism when competition gets the better of someone.<br>
				&emsp;Persistence is paramount when it comes to avoiding stereotype threat. If you feel like you're being stereotyped, the best thing you can do is be persistent. It doesn't matter what people think of you, if your results are good enough, people have to take notice.<br>
				&emsp;Integrity is the most important, because it doesn't apply to the person being stereotyped as much as it applies to the person doing the stereotyping. We cannot rely on other people to change ourselves, and if you have any integrity, you should be able to look at yourself objectively and realize if you are stereotyping.
