			<h2> 4 / 2 2 / 2 0 1 4 - F U N C T I O N A L  vs  O O P</h2>
			<p>
				Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is something that I've been working with for several years now, so I'm pretty familiar with the ins and outs of it. Like its namesake, it focuses around the creation and manipulation of objects. In OOP I can create a cat object, which can have methods/functions for meowing, running, playing etc. I could create subclasses of cat that inherit cat traits, like Bombay or Siamese, and they could interact with Dog objects which have their own subclasses and methods/functions.<br>
				&emsp;Functional Programming is something that I have never worked with, so I am much less familiar with the topic. From my understanding, functional programming has set operations (functions/methods) that cannot be changed, but the objects in functional programming can be changed. Instead of focusing on the objects themselves, it treats objects as malleable work tools and the functions themselves are the infrastructure of the program.<br>
				&emsp;I've seen both sides of the argument as to which programming style is more effective, but overall I plan on sticking with OOP as long as I can, simply because I am much more familiar with it.
