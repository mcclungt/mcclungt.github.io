				This is a somewhat dangerous topic, and it's very difficult to write about from the perspective of a middle class white male, but stereotype threat is a major issue that presents itself in all facets of life. The hardest part about dealing with an issue like stereotype threat is that it deals with the subconscious, thus making it harder to detect and avoid. <br>
				&emsp; While I do face stereotyping on a daily basis, it impede my life path the way it would many others. This injustice does not go unnoticed, however, and I do my best to avoid proliferating the problem. The simplest way to do this is to look at people as human beings first and foremost. If you can separate someone's actions and achievements from their appearance, you can get a better understanding of their personality.<br>
				&emsp; I can't pretend to be completely impartial when it comes to this issue. I can't tell whether or not my subconscious is causing me to act differently. I simply do the best that I can to avoid letting stereotypes affect my judgement.
