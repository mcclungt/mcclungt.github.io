				Tech is a booming industry right now. Every day as technology gets more and more complex, the industry grows little by little. But I've always found it to be more productive to focus on problems rather than bask in bliss so today I'm going to talk about one of the major problems that I find myself running into in the tech world: language diversity and compatibility.<br>
				&emsp;When I first decided that I wanted to learn to program I found myself faced with a decision that I'm sure everyone at dev Bootcamp can relate to: What language should I learn? You see this question asked all over the internet, usually posed with a small clarification like "what should I learn if I want to make a game?" or "what should I learn if I want to make a phone app?".
				If you browse through the responses you will mostly find recommendations, but there's almost always someone who says "it doesn't matter, just pick one and start learning".<br>
				&emsp;I often find myself flip-flopping about whether or not that's the correct answer, but my current conclusion is that it does matter what language you learn, but not as much as you would think. Yes, it's true that it might not be wise to program a game in assembly or a phone app in python but after learning the basics of many languages, you find that the concepts you need to grasp are present in most programming languages, and you can worry about compatibility later on. Honestly, it's going to take you a lot of learning before you'll be able to make a worthwhile app anyway, so whether or not you start in C++ doesn't really matter for the present.<br>
				&emsp;Ultimately, it comes down to the individual to decide what language they want to start learning. Hopefully in the future programmers will find ways to standardize things a little better. But for the time being, well, I guess I'll just have to learn everything.
