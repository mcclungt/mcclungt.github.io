				Classes in Ruby are very similar to classes in every other language, but it might be a little difficult to wrap your head around the concept of classes if you've never worked with programming before. In order to understand classes, you must understand scope.<br>
				&emsp;Scope determines what can access what inside of a program. Class variables, variables that are initialized at the class level, can be used anywhere in the class. Instance variables, on the other hand, can only be accessed inside of the method they are called in. This is the concept of scope.<br>
				&emsp;So if I wanted to (hypothetically) make a class Find, which would find a lost item in my apartment, my roommate could then make a subclass Find Phone that inherits traits from Find. By inheriting, he would be saving time and getting to use part of my Find class, but he would be unable to make changes to the original Find.<br>
				&emsp;Maybe my example was a little bit confusing, but if there's anything to take away from this post it's that you should learn to be careful with scope. On a small scale, scope can sometimes be negligible. But once you're working on a large scale, it becomes very important.
