			<p>
				So I had my first GPS this past Thursday. Unfortunately, no one else signed up for my slot, so I had a one-on-one session with Jonathan Howden. Even though it technically wasn't a guided <em>pairing</em> session, I still learned a lot.<br>
				&emsp;We essentially went through the curriculum bit by bit. He would ask me to read the directions and build something, and I would produce the results to the best of my ability. If I was missing a step, he would nudge me in the correct direction until I figured it out.<br>
				&emsp;Reading the feedback from the session was a good experience. Jonathan's main criticism was that I should test my code more often to pinpoint where errors are. I agree, when I program I like to create a shell/outline for it and work back from there, but it makes more sense to test it piece by piece. I like to hear criticism when it's honest, because there's always room for improvement(especially in programming).<br>
				&emsp; I didn't have an opportunity to write any feedback because I didn't have a partner to review. I enjoyed the solo session, and it was pretty efficient (we finished in around 50 minutes) but I look forward to having a real pairing session soon.
