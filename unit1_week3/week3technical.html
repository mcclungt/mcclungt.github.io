			<p>
				Ruby has many different ways of storing multiple variables. Two of the most common methods are arrays and hashes. But how can you decide which to use for your data structure?<br>
				&emsp;Arrays are found in most programming languages. You can fill arrays with any type of value. Each value will be stored numerically in the array and can be accessed by calling the corresponding number. You can even make multidimensional arrays, so the storage space for arrays is essentially limitless. Arrays are very flexible, so they will work in almost any situation. <br>
				&emsp;Hashes exist in many programming languages, sometimes under different names. They can be stored with keys and values, and can be accessed by either one. Hashes are very useful because keys are much easier to remember than numbers(which are used in arrays), so information in a hash is very well organized. Hashes only really work for data that is arranged in pairs, but it seems to be the organized way to store data when that is the case.<br>
				&emsp; If you're having trouble deciding which structure to use, I think the safest structure to use is an array. Arrays will always work, but they can be confusing to navigate sometimes. If the information can be stored in pairs, such as a phonebook or contact list, try a hash. If you can safely fit the information into a hash, it's usually the better choice.
