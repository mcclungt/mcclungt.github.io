				<b>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</b><br><br>
					About a month ago I got into a serious argument with my roommate. It sounds silly, but it all revolved around whether or not I was feeding my cat enough food.<br><br>
				<b>What was the source of the conflict?</b><br><br>
					Part of it was timing. He was stressed out and said some things that were uncalled for, but I was also in a bad mood and I reciprocated. It was clear the argument wasn't really about the cat food, but more about how we were viewing eachother.<br><br>
				<b>How did you handle that conflict?</b><br><br>
					After we shouted for a bit and we both calmed down, I confronted my roommate because I felt that our argument was too serious to start over something like cat food. I said that there was something bigger that we were arguing, and suggested we figure it out. My roommate declined, and we eventually forgot about it.<br><br>
				<b>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</b><br><br>
					I'm not sure. I still feel like there's some animosity between us, but he's subletting his room right now so it isn't affecting me presently. I tried though.<br><br>
				<b>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</b><br><br>
					Nothing. The argument wasn't bad enough to have a permanent effect on our friendship, but we at least got some things off our chests.<br><br>
				<b>What did you learn from this experience?</b><br><br>
					Honestly? Didn't really learn anything. I guess we both got some catharsis out of it, but I wouldn't change a thing about how I acted.
