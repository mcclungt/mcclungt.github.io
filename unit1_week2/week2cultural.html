			<p>	<b>Exercise 1:</b><br>
				When you think of the times in your life where you&#39;ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Accomplishment</li>
					<li>Competition</li>
					<li>Integrity</li>
					<li>Persistence</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 2:</b><br>
				Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.<br><br>
				I think a person's integrity is a strong show of a person's character. If someone is unable to show consitency in their behavior and actions, I find it difficult to trust them.<br><br>
				<b>Exercise 3:</b><br>
				Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:<br>
				In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>
				Accomplishment - 5<br>
				Competition - 5<br>
				Integrity - 5<br>
				Persistence - 5<br><br>
				<b>Exercise 4:</b><br>
				What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?<br><br>
				I have a friend who works a very strenuous job, although he gets paid very well for it. He is deciding whether or not to leave his job for a job that doesn't pay as well, but has less hours. My recommendation was to pursue whichever avenue allowed him to have the lifestyle he wanted. If he cannot have his intended lifestyle at the new job, he should either reject it or change his rethink his lifestyle.
