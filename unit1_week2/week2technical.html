				Here's a question we've all heard before: what makes javascript so popular? Well, in order to even begin to answer that question, we have to take a look at the history of the language. <br>
				&emsp;Back in 1995, Netscape was in the middle of a turf war for web presence with Microsoft. Netscape seeked an interpretive language that would compliment Java, which was the major competitor with C++ at the time. Programmer Brendan Eich developed javascript with the idea of having a lightweight, easy-to-learn language that nonprofessional programmers could utilize. <br>
				&emsp;By August, 1996, javascript had caught on so much that Microsoft expanded its browser to support javascript. Just a few months later, Netscape submitted javascript to become a web standard, and the rest is history. So why was javascript successful in the first place, and why do we still use it today? <br>
				&emsp;Essentially, javascript became a standardized solution to a common problem: the lack of a universal, user-friendly front-end development language. After all browsers adopted javascript for html scripting, it simply didn't make sense to use anything else. While you can still use VBScript for Internet Explorer, there isn't much of a point in learning VBScript since it doesn't work in any other browser. <br>
				&emsp;Though javascript <em>is</em> really popular today, who is to say that a new language won't replace it in the near future?
